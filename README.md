#Features

Pipeline is a simple and straight forward tool for managing maya projects,
from student shorts to meduim teams working on commercial projects.
It was inspired by the wonderful OpenPipline script, which appears to be discontinued.

**Simple**

Pipeline takes care of versions, nameing convention and folder structure, and nothing gets lost.
Asset bank for quick referecing into animation scenes.
Published assets with versions for easy recoveries.

**Collaborative**

Work on projects via file sharing services like Dropbox.
Users with premissions keep assets safe from less-technical animators.
OSX / Windows support.

**Straight forward**

Embeded nativly into Maya's interface.
Manage all you projects without leaving Maya.
